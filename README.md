Pollutants in the atmosphere is a major problem in metropolitan cities due to vehicle and factory pollution. There is a need to take preliminary measures to overcome this problem since it leads to many health related issues like asthma and heart problems. So, there is a need to predict the level of these toxicants during various times of the day in order to warn the people suffering from these diseases so that they can be more cautious during the critical intervals of the day. We have identified the major pollutants of the atmosphere as NO2 and O3 along with 11 other pollutants which are either meteorological or geographic and particulate concentrations. We have used the techniques for prediction such as Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) and ANFIS(Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems) and compared them to find out that one perfect method that can precisely predict the concentrations for every 8 hours of the day.
